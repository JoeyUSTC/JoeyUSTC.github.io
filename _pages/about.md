About Me
------
I am a computer science PhD student (Mar 2022 - present) in [VCC Imaging Group](https://vccimaging.org) at [KAUST](https://www.kaust.edu.sa/en), supervised by Prof. [Wolfgang Heidrich](https://vccimaging.org/People/heidriw/). My research interests include differentiable ray-tracing/rendering, automatic optics design, and computational imaging. 

<!-- I have worked on DiffLens -->

I obtained my Bachelor degree on physics(major) and computer science(minor) at [USTC](https://en.ustc.edu.cn/). My previous research experience lies on quantum optics and wireless communication. In my free time, I like backetball, travelling and photography. I was a marathon runner(personal record: half-marathon - 79mins, marathon - 3h01min) and a hiker in the past.
