About Me
------
I am a computer science MS/PhD student (Sep 2020 - ) in [Visual Computing Center (VCC)](https://cemse.kaust.edu.sa/vcc) at [King Abdullah University of Science and Technology (KAUST)](https://www.kaust.edu.sa/en), supervised by Prof. [Wolfgang Heidrich](https://vccimaging.org/People/heidriw/). My research interests include differentiable rendering and differentiable lens design. Prior to this, I obtained my Bachelor degree on physics and computer science at [University of Science and Technology of China (USTC)](https://en.ustc.edu.cn/). And my previous research experience lies on quantum optics and wireless communication. 

In my free time, I like photograph(see my photos on [instagram](https://instagram.com/singeryang.cn)), backetball and travelling. I was a marathon runner(personal record: half-marathon - 79mins, marathon - 3h01min) and a hiker(more than 10 mountain/routes) in the past.
