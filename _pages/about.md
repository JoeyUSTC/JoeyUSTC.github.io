About Me
------
I am a computer science MS/PhD student (Sep 2020 - present) in [VCC Imaging Group](https://vccimaging.org) at [KAUST](https://www.kaust.edu.sa/en), supervised by Prof. [Wolfgang Heidrich](https://vccimaging.org/People/heidriw/). My research interests include differentiable ray-tracing, automatic optics design, differentiable rendering and End2End computer visions. Prior to this, I obtained my Bachelor degree on physics and computer science at [USTC](https://en.ustc.edu.cn/). My previous research experience lies on quantum optics and wireless communication. 

In my free time, I like photograph(see my photos on [instagram](https://instagram.com/singeryang.cn)), backetball and travelling. I was a marathon runner(personal record: half-marathon - 79mins, marathon - 3h01min) and a hiker(more than 10 mountain/routes) in the past.
