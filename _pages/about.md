About Me
------
I am a computer science Ms/PhD student (Aug 2020 - present) in [VCC Imaging Group](https://vccimaging.org) at [KAUST](https://www.kaust.edu.sa/en), supervised by Prof. [Wolfgang Heidrich](https://vccimaging.org/People/heidriw/). I am currently working on differentiable rendering and its applications in automatic lens design. My research interests follow the idea of **hardware(optics/sensor) and software(network/ISP) joint design**. My goal is to create a differentiable framework for general imaging processes(photography, sensing, image processing, computer vision, et,al.)


I obtained my Bachelor degree on physics(major) and computer science(minor) at [USTC](https://en.ustc.edu.cn/). My previous research experience lies on quantum optics and wireless communication. In my free time, I like backetball, travelling and photography. I was a marathon runner(personal record: half-marathon - 79mins, marathon - 3h01min) and a hiker in the past.
