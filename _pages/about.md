About Me
------
I am a computer science MS/PhD student (Sep 2020 - ) in [VCC (Visual Computing Center)](https://cemse.kaust.edu.sa/vcc) at [KAUST](https://www.kaust.edu.sa/en), KSA, supervised by [Prof. Wolfgang Heidrich](https://vccimaging.org/People/heidriw/). My research interests include deep learning and co-design of optics and algorithms. Prior to this, I obtained my Bachelor degree on physics and computer science at [USTC](https://en.ustc.edu.cn/), China. And my previous research experience is mainly on quantum optics and wireless communication.  

In my free time, I am a photographer(see my photos on [instagram](https://instagram.com/singeryang.cn)), and marathon runner(personal record: half-marathon - 79mins, marathon - 3h01min). I also like travelling and basketball.
